 # Developing a statistical language model of Turkish that will use N-grams of Turkish syllables
 
 Separate each word into its syllables
 Calculate the 1-Gram, 2-Gram, 3-Gram, 4-Gram and 5-Gram tables for this set using 95% of the set (If the set is too large, you may use a subset). Note that your N-gram tables will be 
mostly empty, so you need to use smart ways of storing this information. You also need to use smoothing, which will be GT smoothing that we have learned in the class.
 Calculate perplexity of the 1-Gram to 5-Gram models using the chain rule with the Markov assumption for each sentence. You will use the remaining 5% of the set for these calculations. Make a table of your findings in your report and explain your results.
 Produce random sentences for each N-Gram model. You should pick one of the best 5 lettersrandomly. Include these random sentences in your report and discuss the produced sentences.
